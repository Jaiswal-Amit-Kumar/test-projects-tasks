Greeting:
Agent: Hello! This is Sarah from TechStore. How can I assist you today?
Customer: Hi Sarah, I’m interested in buying a new laptop.

Needs Discovery:
Agent: Great! Could you tell me what you mainly use your laptop for—work, gaming, or general use?
Customer: Mostly work and some light gaming.
Agent: Got it. And do you have any brand preferences or specs in mind?

Suggestion/Pitch:
Agent: Based on that, I recommend the XPro 15 — it has a powerful processor for multitasking and a dedicated GPU for gaming. Plus, it’s lightweight for travel. We currently have a 10% discount on it this week.
Customer: Sounds good. What about battery life?
Agent: It lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge, perfect for long workdays.

Closing:
Agent: Would you like me to reserve one for you today with free shipping included?
Customer: Yes, please!
Agent: Fantastic! I’ll set that up and send you a confirmation email shortly.
